# Allsale Events — Product Requirements (PRD)

## Original Problem Statement
Build an Eventbrite / BookMyShow-style ticketing platform with full partner-revenue ecosystem. Stack: **React + FastAPI + MongoDB Atlas**, deployed on Vercel + Railway.

## Architecture
- **Backend**: FastAPI, routers in `/app/backend/routers/`, MongoDB Atlas, WebSockets
- **Frontend**: React 19, Tailwind, Shadcn UI, deployed to Vercel
- **Integrations**: Stripe, Resend, Google OAuth, GA4, Emergent LLM Key (Gemini 2.5 Pro)

## Partner / Revenue Programs (4)
1. Affiliates (per-event promo codes)
2. Organizer referrals (flat $50 credit)
3. Influencer hub (event promoters)
4. **Marketing Lead Partners** — admin-controlled lead-gen, configurable % of platform commission on every paid booking, recurring forever. Now includes monthly statement emails + self-serve partner portal at `/partner`.

## What's Implemented (latest session — Feb 2026)
- Event browsing, atomic seat hold, QR e-tickets, dashboards
- Admin → Organizer creation + Event on-behalf-of, real-time Admin↔Organizer chat + typing indicators
- Eventfinda layout, image proxy, sidebar poster, ZIP flyer + Poster-First + AI text overlay
- Blog + SEO + newsletter signup + subscriber fan-out + unsubscribe page
- Protection P&L widget + Marketing Lead Partners
- **Admin Hero Strip (NEW)**: 4 stat cards above tabs at `/admin` — Protection net pool, pending claims, lead-partners unpaid, lead-partners active. Click-through to relevant tab.
- **Marketing partner monthly statements (NEW)**:
  - Template `marketing_partner_statement` in `emails.py` with period/unpaid/lifetime boxes + recent earnings table
  - Endpoint `POST /api/admin/marketing-partners/send-statements` (admin-triggered; cron-able). Stamps `last_statement_sent_at` per partner. Admin button "Email monthly statements" in the Lead partners tab.
- **Partner self-serve portal (NEW)**:
  - Admin grants access via `POST /api/admin/marketing-partners/{id}/grant-portal-access` — creates a `role=partner` user with `linked_partner_id` (or links existing user). Admin shares credentials out-of-band.
  - Public page `/partner` (`PartnerPortal.jsx`) — read-only dashboard with 3 stat cards (organizers / lifetime / unpaid), attached-organizers list, earnings ledger, mailto-Allsale link
  - Backend `GET /api/partner/me` + `GET /api/partner/me/earnings` require `linked_partner_id` on the calling user
  - Read-only on purpose: admin still controls payouts

## Backlog
- P3: Cron the `send-statements` endpoint to run on the 1st of each month automatically
- P3: Flyer template picker (Minimal / Neon / Bold)
- P3: Make `poster_url` field more prominent in CreateEvent
- P3: Add a "Send invitation email" to grant-portal-access so partners get credentials directly instead of out-of-band

## Critical Notes
- Partner login uses standard `/api/auth/login`; partner role is just `user.role="partner"` + `user.linked_partner_id`
- `marketing_partner_id` on organizer user = the partner that BROUGHT them; `linked_partner_id` on partner user = the partner record they CAN ACCESS — DO NOT mix these two fields
- Earnings hook still goes through `_finalize_paid_booking` → `record_partner_earning_for_booking`; idempotent on `(partner_id, booking_id)`
- Newsletter admin endpoints under `/admin/newsletter/...`, partner endpoints under `/admin/marketing-partners/...` and `/partner/me*`
- Emergent LLM Key model must be `gemini-2.5-pro` via LiteLLM
- Google OAuth `redirect_uri_mismatch` & Stripe USD/NZD display are dashboard configs
